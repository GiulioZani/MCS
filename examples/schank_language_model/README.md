# Schank language model
In this example I used the mcs algorithm to compute the similarity between two schank conceptualizations.

The file `shank_graph_similarity.js` is the most useful for understanding how to use the mcs library. 
Whereas the files `index.html` and `main.js` are just to visualize the resulting graphs.
